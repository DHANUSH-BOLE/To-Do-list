### Future improvements

Future improvements may include the following:
#### User Authentication:
Implement user authentication to allow users to sign in and access their own todo lists. This would involve creating user accounts and securely managing user authentication using technologies like OAuth or JWT.

#### Task Sorting and Filtering:
Add functionality to sort tasks based on priority, due date, or category. Also, implement filtering options to view tasks based on different criteria such as completed tasks, overdue tasks, or tasks assigned to specific categories.
#### Edit Tasks:
Enable users to edit task details such as task name and due date after they have been added to the list. This would provide users with more flexibility and control over their tasks.
